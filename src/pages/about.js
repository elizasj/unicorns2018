        <p>
          UFP strives to be a perpetual rough draft, a place to catalogue the
          things that have stumped and/or inspired me as I hash out programing’s
          creative side, and the always expanding web development landscape.
          Graphics & audio, generative art, data-visualisation - these are the
          things that I spend most of my time thinking about in large part
          thanks to the many artists and thinkers who I’ve been lucky enough
          enough to encounter both IRL & URL. Some notes & quotes from some of
          the afforementioned, that have inspired my curiosity:

        <blockquote>
          “What is the poetics of computation? The origin of the word poetics is
          Poïesis, which means to create and give form. What is the form of
          computer? What factors were in place to give this particular form to
          it? … How can computers create the varying senses of time coexisting
          in a space? Can we consider code as language rather than technology?
          After all, computation is not merely a technological subject, but a
          kind of medium and spirit that runs contemporary society.”

        <blockquote>
          “When human beings acquired language, we learned not just how to
          listen but how to speak. When we gained literacy, we learned not just
          how to read but how to write. And as we move into an increasingly
          digital reality, we must learn not just how to use programs but how to
          make them. In the emerging highly programmed landscape ahead, you will
          either create the software or you will be the software. It’s really
          that simple: Program, or be programmed.”
          <br />[ Douglas Rushkoff | Program or be Programmed: Ten Commands for
          a Digital Age ]
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          “The clarity offered by software as metaphor - and the empowerment
          allegedly offered to us who know software - should make us pause,
          because software also engenders a sense of profound ignorance.
          Software is extremely difficult to comprehend. Who really knows what
          lurks behind our smiling interfaces, behind the objects we click and
          manipulate? Who completely understands what one’s computer is actually
          doing at any given moment? Software as a metaphor for metaphor
          troubles the usual functioning of metaphor, that is, the clarification
          of an unknown concept through a known one. For, if software
          illuminates an unknown, it does so through an unknowable (software).
          This paradox - this drive to grasp what we do not know through what we
          do not entirely understand… does not undermine, but rather grounds
          software’s appeal. Its combination of what can be seen and not seen,
          can be known and no known - it’s separation of interface from
          algorithm, of software from hardware - makes it a powerful metaphor
          for everything we believe is invisible yet generates visible effects,
          from genetics to the invisible hand of the market, from ideology to
          culture. Every use entails an act of faith.”
