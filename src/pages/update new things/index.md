I started this blog just over a year ago as new coder, to document the things that I needed to explain to myself and stash away somewhere for safekeeping. This space has been on a brief(-ish) hiatus since may, that crept up on me as Jekyll’s slow churn wore down the enjoyment I’d once taken in writing about things. But I’m back! With a brand new... everything!

After reading <a href="https://www.sarasoueidan.com/blog/jekyll-ghpages-to-hugo-netlify/" target="_blank">Sara Soueidan’s post</a> about migrating from Jekyll/Github Pages to Hugo/Netlify in which she lamented very similar frustrations to my own, I decided to pack up my ideas and move them over to a new digital space.

I won’t go too deep into the joys of <a href="http://gohugo.io/" targer="_blank">Hugo</a> and <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" targer="_blank">Netlify</a>, because honestly, Sara does a much better job than I ever could at walking you through the basics. But I can definitely attest to how simple Hugo makes it to migrate your content from Jekyll, and how insanely fast everything feels in Hugo which runs on <a href="https://golang.org/" target="_blank">Go</a>. I knew Ruby was slow, but I never realised how slow until I was up an running on Hugo. after using Jekyll which runs on Ruby. I also really enjoy the community around Hugo. People are excited about it, and the <a href="http://gohugo.io/documentation/" taget="_blank">docs</a> are up to date and - dare I say it - a pleasure to read.

Also, I’d like to take a moment to tip my hat at Netlify,which is super simple to use from both the CLI or through the site. One of my obsessions when it comes coding anything is finding the simplest way to achieve my goal. After a few regretful years dealing with behemoths like Magento and Wordpress, Jekyll & GitHub Pages felt like a breath of fresh air. And now again, moving everything over to Hugo and Netlify, I’ve discovered a whole new world of simple. And fast! Which is so much more fun. I’ve been able to port over all my new Hugo knowledge into some professional projects as well, which is always satisfying.

While the insides and outsides of this space are new, the content that it contains is still very much in notebook form. I plan to continue writing things in pencil, which as far as coding goes, is the general rule isn't it? Refactoring is just noticing a better way to do something. But I still needed to say it because even now as I look back on the things I wrote about previously, I me-ga cringe at all the wordiness in my writing and naive coding I’ve featured on here. But then again, they say if you’re not cringing at last year’s code, you’re not learning enough. I must be on the right track.

More to come!
