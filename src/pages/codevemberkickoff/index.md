[Codevember](http://codevember.xyz/) is officially upon us!! And what better a reason to finally get down to doing what I set out to do when I created this little online space in the first place - that being to chronicle and catalogue all the useful/interesting/confusing code bits and bobs I encounter as I tumble down the rabbit hole.

For day one I really wanted to do something fun, but nothing too complicated because, well, let's not get ahead of ourselves, hmm? There are many days of coding to come and for sanity sake, I think it might be best to save any ideas leaning to the ambitious side of the spectrum for the weekend when time is up for grabs.

So without further adieu, I give you my 1st contribution to #Codevember: a simple [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) sketch featuring a grid of rectangles, rotating at the same speed, but the same direction. Check out my code to see how I did it - it's nothing fancy persay, but I think it sets the tone well for the rest of the months endeavours.

In fact, I'd originally set out to do this in Processing.py but after running into a confusing scope problem with my rotation variable, (but _only_ that variable, not the other globals, ergh... >.<) I ported my project over to js. If anyone can reproduce this in Python, do ping me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/iamelizasj), I'd be curious to see how you did it.
