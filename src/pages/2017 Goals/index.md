As last year was my first real experience as a dev, my main goal was simply to keep my head above water. Having survived (!!) I figure for year two I ought to set some slightly clearer goals for myself. Yea, I know... _UGH_ bcs who wants to preepmtively disappoint themselves. But they say it can be helpful, (they who? ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯) so I figure I might as well give it a go & see what happens. I now have a better idea too, of the types of things I'm truly interested in in web development, where I want to go, & what I hope to accomplish in this new creative space of mine.

## 1. Javascript

JS is my jam. While I have a solid foundation in Python at this point, I find Javascript, in all it's weirdness, to be really interesting. I want to keep learning as much Vanilla Js as I can. The more I learn the easier it is for me to manipulate exciting frameworks like [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and libraries likes [P5](http://p5js.org/). And it turns out ES6 is actually miles less weird than ES5 #winning

## 2. Tutorials

This blog was was mainly created as a place for me to shove ideas & concepts that I want to remember. It's easier to find them here than to dig through my old notebooks and my illegible chicken-scratch notes. But I want this to be something that, should anyone else land on it, prove to be helpful to them too. Besides, teaching is the best way to learn.

## 3. Interactive audio-visuals

As I've mentioned elsewhere on this blog, I come from a strong creative background in video creation. Having made my fare share of music videos, I'd like to find a way to expand on that through the browser and add an interactive element to the mix. I had started a project 2 years ago, but lacking the technical skills I needed to actually bring my vision to life, it's been sitting on github gathering dust. Daunting as it is to look at old code - and from a n00b no less - I'm going in. Wish me luck.

## 4. Series projects

In keeping with the visual spirit of all my projects, and inspired by [Varun Vachhar](http://varun.ca/)'s [_A Triangle Every Day_](http://winkervsbecks.github.io/a-triangle-everyday/) project, I'd like to start at least one 'series', producing a dynamic visual a week, over the course of the year. January with focus on finding my concept (I'm thinking something with patterns, or basic shapes + primary colors...) and starting February we're off!

## 5. Health

Ok this one isn't so directly related to code, but I'm taking a cue from one of my favourite ladies on the web, [Una Kravets](http://unakravets.com/). Because health is important and anyways, healthier body == healthier mind & a healthier mind == better code. But living in Paris means gyms are cramped and crowded (and ri-di-cu-lously overpriced) which makes me sad because I really enjoyed the [BJJ](http://www.bcnma.com/) I started doing when I lived in Barcelona. I guess it's back to living room Yoga and weekend jogs (something I started while in Berlin this summer, & honestly it's kinda nice!) for me ✌️
